# August 10th: Yippee! 

After importing a few libraries, connecting wires together, a rough draft of the Schematic has been complete! <br>
Currently the plan is to have a 80% keyboard w/ 2 Rotary Encoders, 1 0.96" OLED Screen, 1 Xiao, 1 RP Pico, and Mini RGB Lights! <br>
For the future, I'm hoping to add wireless bluetooth connection to the keyboard! :D
